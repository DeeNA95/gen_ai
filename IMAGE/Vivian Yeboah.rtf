4.1.3 Form of Ownership Analysis\
Table 4.2: Distribution of Form of Ownership\
Based on the data presented in Figure 1.1, the distribution of the form of ownership of garment construction firms within the Kpone-Katamanso Municipal Assembly (KKMA) can be summarized as follows:\
\
Form of Ownership	Number of Firms	Percentage (%)	Total Estimated Number\

Manager/Supervisor-Led	1	4%	15\
Family-Owned	0	0%	0\
Partnership	1	4%	16\
\
Discussion:\
The form of ownership data from the garment construction firms in KKMA reveals that the sector is primarily dominated by private ownership (92%). This indicates a large number of independent, owner-operated businesses. The presence of manager/supervisor-led firms (4%) and partnerships (4%) reflects some degree of formalized and collaborative management in the sector, though these forms are less common. Interestingly, no family-owned businesses were identified in the survey.\

\
4.2.1 Garment Specialization Analysis\
Table 4.3: Distribution of Garment Specialization\
The distribution of garment specialization within the garment construction firms in the Kpone-Kantamanso Municipal Assembly (KKMA) can be summarized as follows:\
\
Type of Garment	Number of Firms	Percentage (%)	Total (Estimated)\
Men\'92s Wear	14	35%	127\
Women\'92s Wear	22	55%	200\
Children\'92s Clothing	21	52.5%	191\
Sportswear	3	7.5%	27\
Uniforms and Workwear	4	10%	36\
\
Discussion:\
The garment construction firms in KKMA primarily specialize in women's wear (55%) and children's clothing (52.5%), reflecting the significant demand for these segments in the local market. Men's wear accounts for 35% of the market, indicating a steady interest in male fashion, while uniforms and workwear (10%) and sportswear (7.5%) represent smaller, but still relevant, portions of the market.\
\
This distribution of garment specialization suggests that the sector is responding to local consumer demands, with a clear emphasis on producing women's and children's clothing. However, the presence of sportswear and workwear highlights the potential for expanding into more niche markets, particularly if there is growing interest in activewear or uniform manufacturing. For businesses looking to diversify, these segments could offer opportunities for growth in the coming years.\
\
4.2.2 Custom Garment Production\
Table 4.4: Custom Garment Production\
From figure 1.3, the distribution of garment firms in the Kpone-Kantamanso Municipal Assembly (KKMA) that produce custom garments can be summarized as follows:\

Custom Garments Production	Number of Firms	Percentage (%)	Total (Estimated)\
Yes	14	56%	204\
No	11	44%	160\
\
Discussion:\
Out of the 25 garment firms in KKMA, 14 firms (56%) are involved in custom garment production, suggesting a substantial demand for personalized clothing in the region. On the other hand, 11 firms (44%) focus on producing standard, ready-to-wear garments, highlighting the diversity within the sector.\
\
The data indicates that while custom garment production is a key area of focus for many firms, there is still a sizable portion of the industry that caters to mass-market needs. This balance between custom and mass-produced garments allows firms to target a wide range of consumer preferences and provides opportunities for growth in both niches.\
